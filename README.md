# About the Project
This program allows a user to type in a burger of their choice. This burger goes to the Fresh/Uneaten burgers, here the user can either "eat" the burger or delete if from the menu. If trhe burger is "eaten", it's moved to the "Devoured" part of the menu. 
The program's front end files are being rendered using Handlebars while the backend is NodeJS. MYSQL is the database in use.
